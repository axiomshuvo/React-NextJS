# React-NextJS


**React & Next.js Web App**

This is a web app built using **React** and **Next.js** to create a fast, interactive, and scalable experience. With **Next.js**, we get all the cool features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), making the app super quick and SEO-friendly.

### Whatâ€™s inside:

* **React** for creating dynamic and reusable UI components
* **Next.js** for powerful routing and the ability to pre-render pages for better performance
* **CSS Modules** or **Styled Components** to style the app with a modern approach
* **API Routes** to add server-side logic in a seamless way
* **Responsive Design** so the app looks great on any device
* **TypeScript** for a safer, more reliable coding experience

### How to Get Started:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`
3. Run the app locally with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
